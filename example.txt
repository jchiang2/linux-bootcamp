Once upon a time there was a programmer. But he didn't ever use git! After all,
he was a good programmer and didn't need to. 

But one day, he made a mistake and wrote buggy code. He searched for hours for
his bug, but couldn't figure it out

Unfortunately he had to start from the beginning and rewrite all his code. If
only he'd been using git and committing regularly!

Random ending...
